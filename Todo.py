### To DO
 ## Drop out of the community should consider the return on investment (a percentage of how much money I received based on how much money I putted back) + Decision Style
 ## trade certificates --> how many cenrtificates a community generates during the simulation
 ## After joining a community, an industry will buy its new energy from the community.
 ## Use LCOE as metric for approving business plans
 ## if strategy is supply energy, the energy will be sold at a cheaper value than grid. This needs to be contemplated on the business plan.
        ## The budget is formed originally by founders investment and increased with selling the cheaper energy sell, profit by selling energy on the grid, new members joining or by new investment by the members
 ## each member, based on its decision-making style, may push other members to vote accordingly to its own preference for the business plan. 
    ## Assess votes, if majority is aligned and prefered style is majority, everything is ok, hierarchycal companies are more bully, etc... 
 ## Consider industries to generate energy by themselves

 ## What costs are divided between pariticipants in a collective scenario?
 ## Soft costs better delivered to the model --30% of installation costs on IRENA --> see more on it

##Add Decision-style to the simulation
#Hierarchical companies prefer to do energy by itself and majority companies prefer to do it on a group (?)
#each company considers initially for their own, if doing together with someone else, split soft costs reducing the general 

##start with a good individual evaluation and then check how it compares with a collective approach


##Communities have better installation costs + OM costs then if industries decide to act on their own. Efficiency of 10% (overall cost)?
