### To DO
 ## 1) Drop out of the community should consider the  Decision Style
 ## 2) trade certificates --> how many cenrtificates a community generates during the simulation
 ## 3) After joining a community, an industry will buy its new energy from the community.
 ## 4) Add Decision-style to the simulation
     ## each member, based on its decision-making style, may push other members to vote accordingly to its own preference for the business plan. 
        ## Assess votes, if majority is aligned and prefered style is majority, everything is ok, hierarchycal companies are more bully, etc... 
        ## Hierarchical companies prefer to do energy by itself and majority companies prefer to do it on a group (?)
